A starter theme based on Underscores and Stix. No child theme is required to use the theme, simply give the theme a new name and away you go. This theme is meant for developers although it does not require much development experience. Aurora is in fact a great learning tool. This theme plays nicely with the Block Editor as well as the Classic Editor. It provides a quick and easy way of building a fully responsive and accessibility-ready theme without much effort.
